## 🔧 Configuration

### Settings File: `~/.kali-gpt/config.json`

```json
{
  "model": "gpt-4o",              // AI model to use
  "temperature": 0.7,              // Response creativity (0.0-1.0)
  "max_tokens": 2000,              // Maximum response length
  "require_confirmation": true,    // Confirm before executing commands
  "auto_copy": true,               // Auto-copy responses to clipboard
  "save_history": true,            // Save conversation history
  "max_history": 10               // Number of exchanges to remember
}
```

### Available Models

**OpenAI (cloud, requires API key):**
- `gpt-4o` - Best performance, most intelligent (recommended)
- `gpt-4o-mini` - Faster, cost-effective
- `gpt-3.5-turbo` - Fastest, basic tasks

**Ollama (local, free):** See [MODELS.md](MODELS.md) for local model options including uncensored models optimized for pentesting.

## 🛡️ Safety Features

### Command Execution Safety

1. **Dangerous Command Detection**
   - Automatically detects destructive commands
   - Requires double confirmation for dangerous operations
   - Protected against: `rm -rf`, `dd if=`, `mkfs`, fork bombs

2. **User Confirmation**
   - Optional confirmation before executing any command
   - Shows command preview before execution
   - Can be disabled in settings for experienced users

3. **Timeout Protection**
   - Commands timeout after 30 seconds by default
   - Prevents hanging processes
   - Configurable per command

### Best Practices

- ✅ Always verify commands before execution
- ✅ Use on authorized targets only
- ✅ Keep API keys secure in `.env` file
- ✅ Review AI suggestions critically
- ✅ Maintain proper documentation of pentests

4. Analyze results with AI
5. Generate enumeration commands for discovered services
```

### 2. Web Application Assessment

```
1. Switch to Web Application Profile
2. Use Workflow Builder: "OWASP Top 10 scan on https://target.com"
3. Execute directory fuzzing
4. Analyze findings
5. Generate SQL injection payloads based on findings
```

## 🔍 Advanced Tips

### Getting Better Results

1. **Be Specific**: "Port scan for SMB on 192.168.1.100" vs "scan target"
2. **Use Context**: AI remembers previous exchanges in session
3. **Switch Profiles**: Use appropriate profile for task
4. **Analyze Outputs**: Always use output analysis feature
5. **Build Workflows**: Automate repetitive tasks

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Ctrl+C` - Interrupt (doesn't exit)
- Choose `0` - Proper exit
- Paste into terminal - Use right-click or Shift+Insert

- ⚠️ **API Security**: Never share your OpenAI API key

### Data Handling

- Conversation history stored locally in `~/.kali-gpt/`
- Logs contain commands and outputs
- No data sent to third parties except OpenAI API
- Clear history regularly for sensitive engagements

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

### ✅ Authorized Use Cases

- Penetration testing engagements
- Bug bounty hunting (authorized programs)
- CTF competitions
- Security research and education
- Red team exercises
- Vulnerability assessments
- Security training
- Personal lab environments

### ❌ Prohibited Use Cases

- Unauthorized access to systems
